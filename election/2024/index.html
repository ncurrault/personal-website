    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    <p>Voting is hard, especially in a place like San Francisco, California, where your ballot is an endless barrage of confusing ballot measures. TODO finish</p>

<h2>Federal</h2>

    <h4>U.S. President / U.S. Vice President</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Kamala Harris / Tim Walz</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Obviously. We're not in a swing state, so this doesn't really matter, but it can't hurt.</li>
        <li>Have you reached out to friends in swing states to make sure they have a plan to vote?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>U.S. Senator (both terms)</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Adam Schiff</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're salty about Schiff's weird "running ads to help the Republican" nonsense from the primary earlier this year,
            I feel that you should probably direct your anger towards <a href="https://calrcv.org">advocating for electoral reform</a>
            rather than actually voting against him.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>U.S. Representative, District 11</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Nancy Pelosi</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Tbh she pushed Biden out, and that's worth a vote in my book.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>State</h2>

    <h4>State Senator, District 11</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Scott Wiener</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>I don't agree with him on everything, but where I don't, I feel like I generally understand his perspective. Except for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1d9nnc2/senator_scott_wieners_bill_will_allow_restaurants/l7fu855/">SB 1524</a>, that's just typical politician bullshit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>State Assembly Member, District 17</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Matt Haney</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Same deal as Wiener, he seems fine I guess.</li>
        <li>He maybe has a <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/06/21/matt-haney-campaign-spending-surprises-donors/">minor ethics scandal</a>, but honestly this seems like more of a primary-campaign issue.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>School/District</h2>

    <h4>Board of Education (“School Board”) Members</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name">
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Jaime Huling</b> &nbsp;
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>John Jersin</b> &nbsp;
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Parag Gupta</b> &nbsp;
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Supryia Ray</b>
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Note: you can vote for up to 4 candidates here.</li>
        <li>Stakes are higher than you might think for a minor election. SFUSD is <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sfusd-closures-enrollment-19752790.php">closing several schools</a> imminently.
            And school boards are rapidly becoming a rising issue in modern politics.</li>
        <li>My slate matches GrowSF's and the Democratic Party's.</li>
        <li><b>Jaime Huling</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Honestly hella impressive. If anyone is endorsed by both GrowSF and the League they're probably doing something right.</li>
            <li>This position seems like a demotion from the City Attorney's office (where she currently works), but she has a child in SF schools and wants to make them better, which is very respectable.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>John Jersin</b> is the most relatable candidate to me, emphasizes computer-science background and importance of teaching that in schools</li>
        <li><b>Parag Gupta</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Part of an alliance with Huling and Jersin, which presumably means they will work well together if all elected</li>
            <li>Has some relevant experience with large budgets at a large housing nonprofit</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Supryia Ray</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Parent who helped with the recall effort</li>
            <li>Attorney (Harvard Law) who argues that her legal experience gives her the critical budget analysis skills that a school board member will need</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Matt Alexander (not endorsed) was on the board during the pandemic-era kerfuffle that resulted in the recall</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Community College Board Trustees</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name">
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Heather McCarty</b> &nbsp;
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Ruth Ferguson</b> &nbsp;
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Aliya Chisti</b> (incumbent) &nbsp;
        <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Luis Zamora</b> (incumbent)
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Note: you can vote for up to 4 candidates here.</li>
        <li>Stakes are higher than you might think for a minor election. CCSF is <a href="">facing an accreditation warning</a>.</li>
        <li>My slate matches GrowSF's and the Democratic Party's.</li>

        <li><b>Heather McCarty</b> is a current professor with broad support</li>
        <li><b>Aliya Chisti</b> is an incumbent, but she was excluded from a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/ccsf-voting-snafu-reverse-trustees-effort-oust-19363749.php">weird late-night meeting</a> where controversial shit went down.</li>
        <li><b>Ruth Ferguson</b> went to community colleges and <a href="https://ruthferguson.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_7732-scaled.jpg">has a very cute dog</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Luis Zamora</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A recent incumbent (appointed by Mayor London Breed to fill a vacancy)</li>
            <li>Gives me “just trying to break into politics” vibes, no CCSF connection as far as I can tell. Side note: I have with these minor positions: are these candidates <i>actually</i> interested in these positions or are they using them as a springboard to get into politics? That said, I'm still voting for this guy because of...</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Alan Wong</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Drafted Free City program as a legislative aide</li>
            <li>On the current board that oversaw the accreditation warning. And he organized the aforementioned <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/ccsf-voting-snafu-reverse-trustees-effort-oust-19363749.php">weird late-night meeting</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>BART Board, District 9</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Joe Sangiardi</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Honestly both candidates seem qualified for this one. So go ahead and vote <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Edward Wright</b> instead if you want.</li>
        <li>In <a href="https://www.kqed.org/voterguide/sanfrancisco/district-races#bart-district-9">KQED interviews</a>, both candidates expressed support for the new BART gates that I like.</li>
        <li>According to friends who are more in the weeds on transit policy, the battleground BART districts aren’t in SF, so this one is more about housing near BART stations/stuff on BART-owned land. And Sangiardi seems more YIMBY than his opponent.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>City and County</h2>

    <h4>Mayor</h4>
    <h5>
    <ol class="candidate-name">
        <li><b>London Breed</b> (incumbent)</li>
        <li><b>Ahsha Safaí</b></li>
        <li><b>Mark Farrell</b></li>
        <li><b>Daniel Lurie</b></li>
    </ol>
    </h5>
    
    <ul>
        <li>My motivating issues are housing, public transit, and public safety. <b>London Breed</b> is doing OK on all of these issues, and I broadly feel that the city is on the right track.</li>
        <li>I get good vibes from <b>Ahsha Safaí</b>. Even though we disagree on some policy, I feel that he would be a good leader.
            Sort of a compromise candidate between the moderate and progressive factions of the city, and someone who knows how to build alliances from his work on the Board of Supervisors.
            But honestly this ranking is probably irrelevant: he's polling in last, so he's going to be the first major-candidate elimination in the RCV runoff algorithm anyway.</li>
        <li><b>Mark Farrell</b> is definitely the toughest on public safety (even <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/03/28/farrell-calls-for-armed-national-guard-troops-in-san-francisco-to-fight-fentanyl/">suggesting a National Guard deployment in the Tenderloin and SoMa</a> to combat the fentanyl crisis).
            However, he's worse on transit (wants to re-open Market Street to private vehicles).
            He also has a concerning <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/mark-farrell-loan-disclosure-house-19808908.php">October Surprise ethics scandal</a>. I wasn't too worried about the campaign finance scandal, but this new one is more concerning to me.</li>
        <li><b>Daniel Lurie</b> is not qualified to be Mayor. He has zero government experience, and his major qualification appears to be building a single apartment building.
            Additionally, he has been running a barrage of attack ads on Farrell, which is a point against him because I don't want to incentivize a negative campaign.
            Also I got bad vibes from him when watching the debate. That said, I'm still ranking him because he seems better than the last major candidate on housing...
        </li>
        <li><b>Aaron Peskin</b> is a NIMBY. He disputed this allegation in one of the debates, but I'm sorry, <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/02/28/despite-housing-crisis-san-francisco-made-it-harder-to-build-homes-in-some-neighborhoods/">introducing legislation to reduce density in your district</a> is practically the definition of NIMBYism.
            He also spent some debate time noting that he's the only candidate in favor of <a href="#prop33">Proposition 33</a>.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>City Attorney</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>David Chiu</b> (incumbent)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Has impressive record, and I haven't read about any scandals in the City Attorney's office.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>District Attorney</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Brooke Jenkins</b> (incumbent)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Brooke Jenkins was appointed by Mayor London Breed following the recall of Chesa Boudin, but voters confirmed this choice in November 2022.
        <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/26/nursing-professor-monifa-willis-a-friend-of-brooke-jenkins-took-on-the-300k-role-in-march-and-continues-to-pull-in-a-six-figure-salary-at-ucsf/">She has a potential scandal</a>:
        she hired her friend without any legal experience for the Chief of Staff role.</li>
        <li>Her opponent, <b>Ryan Khojasteh</b> is also well-qualified if you want to vote for him.
            But I'm still voting for Jenkins because, with the recall in recent memory, I want stability in the DA's office.
            That said, if the scandal offends you, go ahead and vote <i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Ryan Khojasteh</b>.
            Another note about him: he's endorsed by progressive groups like Dean Preston and the League, but his record and <a href="https://ryanforsfda.com/policy/">proposed policies</a> do not scream "Chesa Boudin part 2" to me.
            My best guess is that progressives coalescing around him are likely motivated to oppose Jenkins for <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/S-F-s-new-D-A-is-Brooke-Jenkins-the-17290873.php">her</a> <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/Report-Brooke-Jenkins-took-case-docs-to-use-in-17553931.php">role</a> in the Boudin recall.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sheriff</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>Paul Miyamoto</b> (incumbent)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Incumbent without any real issues or scandals</li>
        <li><i>Side note</i>: if you're considering expressing disapproval with SFPD by voting against the incumbent here,
            note that the Sheriff (somewhat confusingly) is not in charge of the police. They basically just control the jails and
            some other miscellaneous things. This is a weird artifact of San Francisco being both a city and a county:
            normally the Sheriff would be county-wide while each city would have local police.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Treasurer</h4>
    <h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>José Cisneros</b> (incumbent)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Running unopposed, has no issues</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Statewide Measures</h2>

<h4>Proposition 2: $10 billion bond for renovating school facilities</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Pretty standard school funding bull, relatively uncontroversial.</li>
    <li>In general, if something is endorsed by GrowSF and the League (they don't tend to agree on <i>anything</i>), I'm probably voting for it</li>
</ul>

<h4>Proposition 3: Marriage Equality</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>FUCK YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>I literally wrote to legislators in June 2022 asking for this, they did it, and now it's here.</li>
    <li>Make sure to talk about this, particularly if you know anyone who "votes NO on everything" because there are too many propositions.
        Constitutional amendments <i>need</i> to go to the voters even if they are proposed by the legislature (as is the case here).
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Proposition 4: $10 billion bond aimed at fighting effects of climate change (wildfire prevention, nature conservation, etc.)</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Wildfires alone represent a unique threat, better to be proactive than reactive</li>
    <li>Again, no voter guide recommends NO here. And the opponent argument in the pamphlet is that the bond will in fact have to be paid back with taxes. Yeah, sure, *government noises*</li>
</ul>

<h4>Proposition 5: Amend state constitution to lower vote threshold from 2/3 to 55% for local bonds</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>I'm still salty about the Muni funding one not passing.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/prop-5-housing-california-19768871.php">Opponent argument</a> is mostly that the threshold is not lowered for specific types of housing projects.
        But it's not like it makes it any worse for them, they just don't get the threshold bump.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Proposition 6: Ban involuntary servitude</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Slavery = bad</li>
</ul>

<h4>Proposition 32: Raise minimum wage to $18/hour</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>San Francisco has its own higher minimum wage anyway, so this is mostly about the rest of California.</li>
    <li>My initial reaction here was confusion: I thought the current minimum wage law was indexed to inflation.
        Turns out it is, but it's capped at 3.5% annual increases.
        And this proposal will reinstate the CPI-based adjustments after the manual ramp up schedule to $18/hour.
    </li>
    <li>
        I generally prefer stuff like this to be passed via legislature, but this has a provision where the legislature is still allowed to amend it (which is a problem with many initiative statues in general).
    </li>
    <li>
        The math maths. Compounded inflation since 2020 works out to a 20.2% increase in prices, and the proposed increase to $17 in 2025 would bring it in line with this increase (21.4% net increase since 2020), so the <i>real minimum wage</i> is effectively identical.
        The next increase to $18 is impossible to gague because we don't know next year's inflation figures yet, however.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="prop33">Proposition 33: Repeal Costa-Hawkins, allowing more local rent control</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-x-square-fill"></i> <b>NO</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Let's start by arguing against this without assuming any housing opinions.
        This same proposal has already been considered in <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_10,_Local_Rent_Control_Initiative_(2018)">2018</a> and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_21,_Local_Rent_Control_Initiative_(2020)">2020</a>.
        It failed resoundingly both times.
        If you don't get the answer you want at the ballot box, you can't just keep asking until you get the policy you want.
        It's a waste of public funds (printing these voter pamphlets isn't cheap) and voters' time.
        Passing something on the third try like this would set a terrible precedent.
    </li>
    <li>This is shitty housing policy. <a href="https://cayimby.org/blog/ahf-rent-control-measure-analysis/">California YIMBY has a good summary of why</a>,
        but the TL;DR is that rent control is fine as long as recent construction is exempt.
        When rent control is imposed as soon as a new building is constructed, builders are much less certain that they can turn a profit, so it's harder to get an investor, and the building never happens.
        If you build in a buffer, investors are assured a finite period of (e.g.) 15 years. And after that point, rent control can <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/11/1/rent-control-is-an-anti-displacement-policy-not-an-affordability-policy">solve displacement problems</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><i>Our problem is that we don't have enough housing, and we need to build more.</i></b> And this measure does <i>nothing</i> to encourage actually building apartments.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is room for reforming Costa-Hawkins. It uses a static date in the 90s as a cutoff instead of a rolling one, which would really makes more sense.
        But there's progress in the legislature: they enacted <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482">statewide rent control</a> that uses a rolling window, but its limits are kinda half-assed: they only cap it at 10% (or 5% plus inflation if that's lower).
    </li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO huntington beach proposal -->

<h4>Proposition 34: Fuck AHF</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>This is the spiciest propositon on the ballot. It's essentially a bill micro-targeted at a controversial group known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_Healthcare_Foundation">AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF)</a>.
    <b><i>TL;DR if you hate the AHF vote YES, if you love them vote NO, and if you've never heard of them keep reading.</i></b>
    </li>
    <li>So what makes AHF so controversial?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>AHF formed during in the late 80s at the peak of the HIV/AIDS crisis. They originally focused on hospice care, but as HIV treatments were discovered, they pivoted to offering various services
            to help prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. You may also be familiar with Out of the Closet, a thrift store they set up to help raise money.
            As of today, their reach has expanded globally, and they operate many clinics and pharmacies.</li>
        <li>
            Although ostensibly a healthcare organization, AHF is also <a href="https://therealdeal.com/la/2024/04/18/aid-healthcare-foundation-buys-buildings-on-las-skid-row/">one of the largest landlords in Los Angeles</a>.
            They operate these properties has led to them being <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-03-08/homeless-housing-aids-healthcare-foundation-lawsuit-skid-row-tenants">accused of being a "slumlord"</a>.
            <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2023-11-16/aids-healthcare-foundation-low-income-housing-landlords">
                The LA times did a deep dive into issues with AHF-owned housing here.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            The AHF and its president also advocate against building more housing. They sponsored Proposition 33 this election and its two similar predecessors that failed in previous elections.
            They also <a href="https://www.advocate.com/hiv/2017/3/08/worlds-largest-aids-organization-just-flushed-millions-down-toilet">sued to block construction near AHF's headquarters that would block his view of the Hollywood Hills</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Even within the AIDS advocacy space, they have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/magazine/the-ceo-of-hiv.html">received pushback</a> for their opposition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-exposure_prophylaxis_for_HIV_prevention">PrEP</a>,
            a drug that helps prevent one from contracting HIV by inhibiting the functionality of reverse transcriptase enzyme that the virus uses to replicate. (Ok, I won't go further down this science rabbit hole because it's really not relevant, but the way PrEP works is pretty cool.)
        </li>
        <li>
            The AHF receives a large amount of money from the federal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/340B_Drug_Pricing_Program">340B Drug Pricing Program</a>.
            In a nutshell, the program <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/prop-34-prescription-california-19740200.php">"allows nonprofit health care providers serving low-income patients to buy prescription drugs from manufacturers at a discounted price. Providers can then charge insurers full price for the drugs &mdash; and pocket the difference."</a>
            California is trying to close this loophole by having Medi-Cal Rx only cover the actual drug costs plus a small fee.
        </li>
        <li>So to recap: they take <i>public money from the subsidized drugs under 340B program and use it to buy apartment buildings and run controversial political campaigns</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>OK, so what does this proposition actually do? It bans companies who rely on 340B funding from using 98% for anything except direct patient care. Huh, I wonder who that could apply to? (As far as anyone can tell, literally nobody but the AHF.)</li>
    <li>Finally, regardless of how you feel about the AHF, there are still some (extremely valid) arguments for voting <i class="bi-x-square-fill"></i> <b>NO</b>.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/prop-34-prescription-california-19740200.php">Editorial in the Chron</a></li>
        <li>This sets a bad precedent. While the AHF is bad, it's not great to set a precedent of having interest-group squabbles play out on every ballot in the most populous state.</li>
        <li>It's a blatant act of revenge for political speech. As the Voltaire quote goes, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."
            The AHF has a right to advocate for shitty policy, and maybe we should defend that right to the death.
        </li>
        <li>That said, I'm still a <b>YES</b> because (a) I'm really uncertain how another group could be targeted like this; AHF's funding model is one-of-a-kind and (b) while AHF has free speech, we do not need to spend Medi-Cal on that speech.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Proposition 35: Make existing tax permanant, using it to fund Medi-Cal services</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>This is a budget set-aside to fund many Medi-Cal services. It has very broad support.</li>
    <li>That said, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/endorsement-california-proposition-35-medical-19758410.php">there is some opposition</a>.
    I feel that it does more harm than good by effectively keeping Medi-Cal funding from being in flux at annual budget negotiations.
    Additionally, due to some complicated ACA provisions, the tax needs to be approved by the federal government every time we change it,
    but this proposition has an escape valve (legislative supermajority) to amend it if needed to preserve federal medicaid funding.
    </li>

<h4>Proposition 36: Reform Prop 47</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
TODO

<h2>Local Measures</h2>

<h4>Measure A: Schools Improvement and Safety Bond</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Standard infrastructure bond with broad support</li>
</ul>

<h4>Measure B: Community Health and Medical Facilities, Street Safety, Public Spaces, and Shelter to Reduce Homelessness Bond</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Standard infrastructure bond with broad support</li>
    <li>Again, GrowSF and the League agree so it seems pretty uncontroversial</li>
</ul>

<h4>Measure C: Inspector General</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Proponents argue more oversight is necessary to avoid corruption</li>
    <li>Opponents argue that it just adds bureaucracy</li>
    <li>It only "adds bureaucracy" in the form of a <i>parallel</i> method for detecting goverment problems, I really don't see much downside risk.</li>
    <li>There is a need to increase government ethics oversight due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Department_of_Public_Works_corruption_scandal">the recent DPW scandal</a>, and I haven't heard any counter-proposals.</li>
    <li>In GrowSF's redundancy argument, the only position that could really be viewed as redundant is the City Services Auditor, which this role can share Controller's Office staff with anyway.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Measure D: City Commissions and Mayoral Authority</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-check-square-fill"></i> <b>YES</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Removes bureaucracy</li>
    <li>All counter-arguments in the pamphlet are people arguing that some minor commissions do important work, which they do. They can continue to do this work as advisory bodies or under corresponding departments.</li> 
    <li>We have <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/commission-san-francisco-city-19524342.php">twice as many commissions</a> as comparable cities like Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Measure E: Creating a Task Force to Recommend Changing, Eliminating, or Combining City Commissions</h4>
<h5 class="candidate-name"><i class="bi-dash-square-fill"></i> <b>LEAVE IT BLANK</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>This would set up a commission to recommend removing commissions. And it's a competing measure, so if both D and E pass, only the one with more votes takes effect.</li>
    <li>Savvy voting on competing requires some <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40649448">interesting game theory</a> due to an issue with our electoral system.</li>
    <li>I am leaving it blank because I do feel that creating this task force would be better than nothing. The <a href="https://www.sf.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Commissions%20Impossible%20Report.pdf">"Commission Impossible" Civil Grand Jury report</a>
        did specifically recommend as much: "The rich irony of recommending a new commission to reduce the number of commissions is not
        lost on us. However we believe such a body is vital in order to optimize and streamline the city’s
        byzantine commission system."</li>
    <li>
        If you are truly ambivalent between this and the status quo (or actively oppose it), consider a <i class="bi-x-square-fill"></i> <b>NO</b> vote instead.
    </li>
</ul>
